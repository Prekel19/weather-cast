# WeatherCast Project

## Overview

The WeatherCast project is a React-based web application which can display current weather and weather forecast for selected city. Apart from that user also have option to check wind, pressure, temperature and more on weather map. Leveraging React + Vite for performant and efficient development setup, TypeScript for robust typing, shadcn for few components and SCSS for styling and responsive design. I used WeatherApi(https://www.weatherapi.com/) for city search, current weather, weather forecast and OpenWeatherMap API(https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather map.
